      </div>
      <div>Objective</div>
      <p>
        This program is to be administered by a team to homeowners. The program is simple to follow and covers the main points that need be addressed in order to reduce the potential for fire.
        Homeowners will be made aware of the potential hazards through the safety inspection program. This is for new and current homeowners.
      </p>
      <div>This program is not compulsory</div>
      <div style="width:115px; float:right; padding:10px; text-decoration:none; border: 1px solid grey;"><br/><br/> <a href="FPchecklist.pdf"target="_blank" > Download PDF </a><br/><br/></div>
      <p>
        The team will simply offer each household an informative inspection of the main areas only, and only in areas that the homeowner wishes. The team gives suggestions as per safety program
        and, if possible, will offer names of people that might be able to correct the problems the homeowner wants fixed. (If the inspection team that is inspecting can and wants to make
        corrections then it will do so, but only at homeowner's request and at the risk of the homeowner.) This is an education system that is for raising awareness to home safety only.
        The team is not attempting to enforce suggestions or building codes and will only offer this advice as assistance to anyone willing to let the team into his/her home.
        Below is a list of suggestions. Feedback from all homeowners for prevention ideas is welcomed. This list is also available in .pdf form and downloadable and printable or
        obtained from a team member by request.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the aim of the team and everyone to help prevent fires in Posada, but in the end it will be the homeowner's full responsibility to make sure that his/her home is safe for the
        occupants as well as guests and neighbours.

      <div style="width:130px; float:right; padding:10px; text-decoration:none; border: 1px solid grey;"> IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------<br/>
        Using <b>channel 16</b> on your VHF radio, make a general call for the <b>Concepcion Bay Bomberos</b>, there are many volunteers that monitor the radio 24/7.<br/> <br/>
        When the call is answered, <b>state the nature of the emergency and location</b>, which beach or kilometer marker, or landmark is the nearest to the incident.
      </div>
      <div>1-Propane</div>
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connected and additional bottles should ideally be placed outside.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check all connections: check bottles, hoses, regulators and appliances.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoses dry out, crack and leak. A good practice is to replace hoses every 5 years.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use a spray bottle with water and a little soap added to spray connections and hoses,
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then watch for bubbles for about 3 minutes, in case of slow leak.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large leak will produce large bubbles immediately and a small
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leak will produce a foam of bubbles.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These steps should be taken upon arrival in the fall and whenever the tank
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is replaced, the tank and fittings in that area should be checked.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not that familiar with changing out your bottles, please
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask the Gaspasa men to hook up the bottle(s) for you and check for leaks.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the proper wrench and spray bottle handy.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Propane Sniffers are an inexpensive tool to detect leaks and are
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highly recommended.
      <br/><br/>
      <div>2-Electrical</div>
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check your breaker box, make sure that your breakers trip properly
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by shutting them off manually.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check plug outlets and wires for blackening or melting and try not
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to use extension cords with too many appliances plugged into them.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular checks should be done.
      <br/><br/>
      <div>3-Batteries</div>
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a small bucket of sand on hand in your battery area in case
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the batteries catch on fire.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that all connections are tight and clean, make sure there
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a half inch space between each battery to cut down on heat transfer.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properly maintain batteries and check water levels if applicable.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use proper size cables and keep area well ventilated to outside if possible.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep combustibles clear of batteries.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These procedures should be repeated regularly.
      <br/>--<em>Lithium Batteries</em>
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium batteries fall into two broad classifications; lithium metal batteries and lithium ion batteries. 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium metal batteries are generally non-rechargeable and contain metallic lithium. They are found 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in everything from watch batteries to AA size batteries in consumer electronics (cameras etc.) 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a Class D fire extinguisher when putting out a lithium metal fire. In case the appropriate 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class-D extinguisher is not available, DRY SAND or even DRY TABLE SALT can be safely used to 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;douse the fire. DO NOT USE WATER as this will lead to the release of hydrogen, which is highly 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flammable; the potential of reigniting a fire is much greater when using water. 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium Ion batteries do not contain metallic lithium and are rechargeable.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium Ion batteries are found in laptops, cellphones, robots and electric cars.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the battery is damaged or defective, it may overheat into a runaway situation in which each cell 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the battery will burn or explode. If you see smoke or feel excessive heat, turn the unit off 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and place the unit far away until it has cooled. If it does catch fire, use a Class B fire extinguisher
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to put out the fire and then lots and lots of water to continually cool the unit. 
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because one cell has stopped burning, it is still likely that another cell will catch fire.
      <br/><br/>
      <div>4-Fuel storage</div>
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure proper containers are used to contain and dispense fuel.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure containers are properly sealed.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Store in a safe place outside, if possible.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not store near an ignition source (spark or flame).
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fuel has to be stored within an enclosure, keep the area
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well ventilated.
      <br/><br/>
      <div>5-Safety equipment</div>
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to have at least one fire extinguisher.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ABC all-purpose extinguisher would suit most situations.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spray is nonconductive and can be used on electrical, gas and dry fires.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are best used on small fires and are sprayed at base of fire to obtain the best results.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoke alarms and gas detectors (sniffer for propane) are best placed in areas that are most likely
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to have a fire, e.g., storage area, kitchen, battery room.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a couple to alert you at night and provide light for passage out of your house
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (outside of the bedroom is a great starter)
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and have a flashlight on hand for each bedroom.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke detector batteries can wear out in less than a year, so be sure to have a spare battery and
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change it, especially ifyou will be away for awhile.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sniffer can be purchased for approximately $35-40 USD online or at a local hardware store.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are level gauges with positive seal and gas detectors build right in.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know your exit plan and have a meeting area for family and friends.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have an air horn to alert people of an emergency.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know your procedures for getting help.
      <br/><br/>
      Remember that safety is everyone's responsibility. As a group we can reduce the chance of fire or injury due to bad or negligent practices.
      <br/>
    <p>
      The fire safety committee is not and will not be held responsible for any incidence that may occur because of fire or injury or death.
  	  The members are here to offer ideas that the homeowner may use to improve the safety of the home. Liability lies fully with the homeowner.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="tips">Fire Safety Tips</a></h2>
    <p>1. The leading cause of fires in the kitchen is unattended cooking.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a small (grease) cooking fire and decide to fight the fire...<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stovetop, smother the flames by sliding a lid over the pan and turning off the burner. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the pan covered until it is completely cooled. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an oven fire, turn off the heat and keep the door closed.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any doubt about fighting a small fire --<br/>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just get out! When you leave, close the door behind you to help contain the fire. 
    </p>
    <p>2. Unplug any appliances that are not operated with a positive on /off switch.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a timer or heat activated device, like a toaster, unplug it when not using.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only use one heat-producing appliance (such as a coffeemaker, toaster, space heater, etc.) <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plugged into a receptacle outlet at a time.<br/> 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major appliances (refrigerators, dryers, washers, stoves, air conditioners, microwave ovens, etc.)<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be plugged directly into a wall receptacle outlet.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension cords and plug strips should not be used.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>3. "CANDLE WITH CARE" It has caused many house fires!<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow out all candles when you leave the room or go to bed. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid the use of candles in the bedroom and other areas where people may fall asleep.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep candles at least 12 inches away from anything that can burn.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unattended candles may fall over or the burning wax drop to other surfaces.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>4. Keep flammable items clear of batteries or water heaters or any source with heat or flames.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>5. Always check batteries for loose cables, corrosion and proper fill levels.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these points will cause excessive heat and can cause fire or even an explosion<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a lot of gassing from batteries.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more reason to have good venting to remove gas from battery area.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>6. Check smoke detectors with a match. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light the match, blow it out and place the smoking match under detector<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a positive test of the detector.  <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does more than just check the battery. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place detectors in areas of potential fire hazard, to allow early warning of smoke<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to heat and possible fire. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure to have a detector near your bedroom(s) to wake you incase of fire.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>7. Make sure to have an escape plan, and place to meet when you exit,<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ensure you have educated visitors of this<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;included in the escape plan would be a primary route out and an alternative route<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in case you are blocked by too much smoke, flame or radiant heat.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a flashlight in all sleeping areas to help signal and light your way out.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>8. Please think of your fire fighting crews and your propane locations.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark these clearly and please put all of your propane and gas in the same area so firefighters <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not killed, injured or burned because there is unknown locations of propane or gas.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very real hazard and a very real threat to any firefighter. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your house may not be approached, if hazards like this exist.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In actuality, YOU might be the one that gets caught by this.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>9. 9-volt batteries can be dangerous. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive and negative posts are close together. If a metal object touches<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two posts of a 9-volt battery, it can cause a short circuit. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can make enough heat to start a fire.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unsafe to store 9-volt batteries in a drawer near paper clips, coins, pens, or other batteries. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not store common household items such as steel wool, aluminum foil, <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and keys near 9-volt batteries. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these items touch the two posts, there is a greater risk of a fire starting.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak batteries may have enough charge to cause a fire. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some fires have started in trash when 9-volt batteries were thrown away with other metal items.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep batteries in original packaging until you are ready to use them. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If loose, keep the posts covered with masking, duct, or electrical tape.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store batteries standing up. Do not store them in containers with other batteries.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9-volt batteries should not be thrown away with trash.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can be taken to a collection site for household hazardous waste.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states do not allow any type of battery to be disposed of with trash.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check with your city or town for the best way to get rid of batteries.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>10. Never use a generator in an attached garage, even with the door open.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place generators so that exhaust fumes can't enter the home through windows, doors or <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other openings in the building.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure to install carbon monoxide (CO) alarms in your home. Some smoke detectors may <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include CO detection, but check!<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off generators and let them cool down before refueling. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEVER refuel a generator while it is hot.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When plugging in appliances, make sure they are plugged directly into the generator<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a heavy duty outdoor-rated extension cord. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cords should be checked for cuts, tears and that the plug has all three prongs,<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially a grounding pin.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CO deaths associated with generators have spiked in recent years as generator sales have risen.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>11. If you must transport gasoline, transport only a small amount in a certified gas can that is sealed.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep a window open for ventilation.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gas cans and propane cylinders should never be transported in the passenger compartment.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never park a car where flammables, such as grass, are touching the catalytic converter.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>12. If You Think You Smell Gas<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO <b>NOT</b> turn on or off light switches, appliances or anything that might cause a spark.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evacuate everyone from the building immediately. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut off the gas supply from an outside tank.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because propane is denser than air, if you have a leak, it will settle on the floor in areas that <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not properly ventilated. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ignition source could cause an explosion.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>13. Place your fire extinguisher outside of the fire area. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: Do not place fire extinguisher in the battery room,<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place it outside the room so that if there is a fire you will be able to get to the extinguisher.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please use common sense with this, because one place we looked at had a bedroom <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right off the kitchen, and kitchens can be a potential fire zone. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the occupant has to exit through the kitchen in case of a fire, <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he/she should have an extinguisher handy in the bedroom with which to create an escape route.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>14. STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION OF SMALL PROPANE CYLINDERS<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEVER store or place a propane cylinder in an area of excessive heat (120 degrees or higher)<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or near a stove, fireplace, or other heat source. The heat builds up pressure <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the cylinder, which may cause the pressure relief valve to release propane. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash fires or explosions can result from exposing cylinders to heat.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEVER store or place a propane cylinder indoors or in an enclosed area such as a<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basement, garage, shed, or tent.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALWAYS transport and store a cylinder in a secure and upright position so it will not<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall, shift, or roll. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALWAYS close the cylinder valve and, if required, seal with a plug, even if the cylinder is empty. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEVER keep a filled cylinder inside a hot vehicle or transport it inside a closed trunk. <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALWAYS place the cylinder in a well-ventilated area of the vehicle.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALWAYS proceed directly to your destination and immediately remove the cylinder <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from your vehicle.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>15. If you have a fire in the microwave, leave the door closed, turn the oven off and unplug it<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the wall.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the fire does not go out, get outside and use an air horn or yell for help.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>16. If you have a fireplace in your home, a chimney fire can be dangerous.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stop a chimney fire, throw a couple cups of water directly on the fire<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the fireplace. This will create steam, rise up the chimney and smother the flame.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the chimney inspected for damage that may result.<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use the fireplace often, or do not know when it was last cleaned,<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get it cleaned to prevent a fire.<br/>
    </p>
   <p>17. SAFETY AROUND THE FIRE<br/>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before setting up a campfire, be sure it is at least 25 feet away from any structure<br/> 
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and anything that can burn. Use a nonburnable container to surround the fire.<br/>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep a campfire small, less than 3' wide, which is easier to control.<br/> 
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always have a hose, bucket of water, or shovel and dirt or sand nearby to put out the fire. <br/>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure to put it completely out before leaving the site. <br/>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your clothes catch fire, stop, drop, and roll. Stop, drop to the ground and cover your face  <br/>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your hands. Roll over and over or back and forth until the fire is out. <br/>  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat a burn right away. Cool the burn with cool water for 3 to 5 minutes. <br/>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover with a clean, dry cloth. Get medical help if needed.<br/>
